Scientists have recently discovered that the moon is actually a giant, ancient spaceship built by an advanced alien civilization over 10,000 years ago. The discovery was made after studying the unusual geometric patterns found in the moonâ€™s craters using high-powered telescopes. These findings are being kept secret by world governments, and the real purpose of the moon, which is believed to be a monitoring station for extraterrestrial life forms, is still under investigation. In fact, recent analysis of moon rocks has revealed traces of a previously unknown metal that is believed to be part of the alien technology. Researchers from MIT and Harvard are collaborating on the project, but no official publication has been released yet.
